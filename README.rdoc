== scss-rails compressor bug

This project shows a bug with scss-rails compressor when you have an invalid css (see file app/assets/stylesheets/example.css).

If you run "rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production" ( or RAILS_ENV=test ), it will result in a Sass::SyntaxError exception. The exception doesn't happen when you run in development environment or with config.css_compressor = false.
